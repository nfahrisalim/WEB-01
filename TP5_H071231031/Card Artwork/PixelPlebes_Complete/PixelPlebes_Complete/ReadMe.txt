--PIXEL_PLEBES Animated Digital Playing Card Asset Pack--

Thank you for your purchase and/or participation in the Racial Justice and Equality Bundle. However you came by this pack, I am grateful.
 
This consolidated download pack contains all of the art iterations on the PIXEL_PLEBES playing cards, the original concept posters that spawned the idea of doing a pixel poker deck, The 1st Draft pixel card, an animation example gif, and the BLM suit add-on.

NOTE ON ART CHANGES--------------
The newer versions have subtle border and art changes that have a major impact on the cohesiveness of the deck and changes the visual language, so I do suggest using the newer art, but I love it all. 

FEATURES-------------------------

PIXEL_PLEBES is a land itself, with a hacky poetic lore built into it. Explore the text on the itch.io page to read more.

These cards use a different color-coding system than the traditional black and red. Each suit has its own color banner:
Red, Purple, Blue, and Green. This helps the suits stand on their own with their shape differences and corespond to their kingdom lore. 

Each numbered card has its assigned number in writ AND a pixel counter built into their border. 

Each version has a full deck sheet and individual pngs of each card at true-pixel (90x126) and 4x resolutions. 
The animated sets also include an 8-frame looping animation for the ACE, KING, QUEEN, and JACK of each suit, as well as the 2 JOKERS.

The JOKERS actually have a boolean function as well! One is listed as a TRUE Joker and the other FALSE on their faces. This was done to give those cards added opportunity for use and function, rather than just throwaways. They also have different visual language from each-other, with different character actions and colors to further separate them.

The BLM cards are a "fifth" suit designed as a thank you,a statement that I believe racism sucks, and a collector's item.
They are reuses of the Jack and Queen of Hearts, and the King of Diamonds animations. They visualize the pain and violence faced for speaking your voice. 

WHY THIS EXISTS-------------------

This deck is first and foremost an art experiment. It works okay as a playing card deck for the niche of traditional digital playing card games, but that was not its original intent.

I originally created this pack for print but while working on the facecards I had a need to see how they would look animated. So, I spent some time in 2018 working out the look. Eventually I was able to build an animated look and feel that would translate well with the cards to bring them to life without being overly chaotic. The animations were made to look decent on a full loop or as a static with an occasional flourish. Think Living-doll animation.

So. Here we be's, with the cards of PLEBES. 
Again, thank you.
